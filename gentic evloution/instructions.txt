cell wall strengh increases the time it stays in maturity for more offspring, in exchange for a longer inital growth
large leaf size increases energy aquired per turn, but larger leaves increases the chance of being eaten
large root networks improves surival in dry enviroments, but increases chance of death in wetter enviroments
having a storage root allows skipping the growth stage and allows for surival after "death cases" after maturity, but needs stored energy from the leaves. if it reaches 0 it dies.
the higher the colour shade, the lighter the leaves, meaning that they can surive high tempretures better, but is less efficent at converting energy.
when passing down the genes it will take half of 2 random mature parents in the field
mutation is random ivrelent of the all other conditions when passing down the genes, and is only affected by the radiation stat
